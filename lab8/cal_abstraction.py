#  Calendar - Functional and imperative programming in Python
#
#  Module: cal_abstraction.py
#  Updated: 2005-09-27 by Peter Dalenius
#    Translated to Python in 2012 by Peter L-G
#    Translated to English in 2013 by Anders M.L.
#    Changes in 2020 by Jonas K (NamedTuple, type hints, ...)
#  Dependencies:
#    None
# =========================================================================

# This module contains the definitions of the data types used by
# the calendar, including both the actual type definitions
# (usually using NamedTuple) and the low-level primitives that
# are used for manipulating the associated data.

# The module also contains a number of useful functions that are
# related to these datatypes, but that do not actually depend on
# how the datatypes are represented.  These should be clearly
# separated in the code below.
